            Light penetration depth in biological tissue is limited by tissue scattering. Correcting scattering becomes particularly challenging in scenarios with limited photon availability and when access to the transmission side of the scattering tissue is not possible. 
          </p>
          <p>  
            Here, we introduce a new two-photon microscopy system with Fourier-domain open-channel coupling for scattering correction (2P-FOCUS). 2P-FOCUS corrects scattering by intensity modulation in the Fourier domain, leveraging the nonlinearity of multiple-beam interference and two-photon excitation, eliminating the need for a guide star, iterative optimization, or measuring transmission or reflection matrices. 2P-FOCUS can also correct scattering beyond the limitation of the memory effect by automatically customizing correction masks for each subregion in a large field-of-view. 
          </p>
          <p>  
            We provide several proof-of-principle demonstrations here, including focusing and imaging through a bone sample, and imaging neurons and cerebral blood vessels in the mouse brain ex vivo. 2P-FOCUS significantly enhances two-photon fluorescence signals by several tens of folds compared to cases without scattering correction at the same excitation power. 2P-FOCUS can also correct tissue scattering over a 230 x 230 x 500 Âµm<span class="superscript">3</span> volume, which is beyond the memory effect range. 2P-FOCUS is able to measure, calculate, and correct scattering within a few seconds, effectively delivering more light deep into the scattering tissue. 2P-FOCUS could be broadly adopted for deep tissue imaging owing to its powerful combination of effectiveness, speed, and cost.

              <span class="caption">a</span>, Without correction, all pixels of the digital micromirror device (DMD) are turned on, allowing all incident light to pass through to the scattering sample. The incident light is scattered and cannot form a tight focus. 
              <span class="caption">b</span>, The process of generating a correction mask involves three steps. The first step is to project random intensity patterns, which are orthogonal to each other, onto the DMD and record the corresponding fluorescence intensity using a photomultiplier tube (PMT). The second step is selecting the random masks that correspond to high fluorescence intensity and summing these masks to create a grayscale correction mask. The third step is to binarize the grayscale correction mask for display on the DMD. 
              <span class="caption">c</span>, With correction, the binary correction mask is projected on the DMD, allowing only the beams that interfere constructively pass through. The illumination power on the sample is maintained at the same level before and after correction by increasing the input power to the DMD to compensate for the power loss due to turning off some pixels. The correction results in a brighter focus compared to the case before correction. 
              <span class="caption">d</span>, Optical schematic diagram of 2P-FOCUS. A femtosecond laser at 1035 nm is used as the light source. A half-wave plate (HWP) and a polarized beam splitter (PBS) are used to control the laser power. A pair of scanning mirrors (SM) is used to scan the focus across the field-of-view. A grating is used to compensate for the spatial dispersion caused by the DMD. Three 4-<i>f</i> systems are implemented with pairs of relay lenses (L1 and L2, L3 and L4, L5 and the tube lens). DMD is located on the conjugate plane of the objective lens's (OL) back aperture. The objective lens focuses the beams on the sample and collects emitted fluorescence. Fluorescence is detected by a PMT after passing through a dichroic mirror (DM), a collection lens, and a color filter. Sample is mounted on a linear translation stage for collecting z-stack images

            There's a lot of excellent work that was introduced around the same time as ours.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09125">Progressive Encoding for Neural Optimization</a> introduces an idea similar to our windowed position encoding for coarse-to-fine optimization.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.albertpumarola.com/research/D-NeRF/index.html">D-NeRF</a> and <a href="https://gvv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/nonrigid_nerf/">NR-NeRF</a>
            both use deformation fields to model non-rigid scenes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some works model videos with a NeRF by directly modulating the density, such as <a href="https://video-nerf.github.io/">Video-NeRF</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~zl548/NSFF/">NSFF</a>, and <a href="https://neural-3d-video.github.io/">DyNeRF</a>

            There are probably many more by the time you are reading this. Check out <a href="https://dellaert.github.io/NeRF/">Frank Dellart's survey on recent NeRF papers</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/yenchenlin/awesome-NeRF">Yen-Chen Lin's curated list of NeRF papers</a>.
